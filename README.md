# MatrixIslandsCounter

This will count how many islands are in a sliced matrix.
Use a symbol ('9' in this example) to know the limits of the islands

matrix(5,5)

0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0

so

0 0 9 0 0
0 0 9 0 0
0 0 9 0 0
0 0 9 0 0

then

1 1 9 2 2
1 1 9 2 2
1 1 9 2 2
1 1 9 2 2

total island = 5
